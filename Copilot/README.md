# Windows Copilot Activation for European Systems

## Overview
This repository contains a script that enables the use of Windows Copilot on European systems. Due to the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA), Windows Copilot is not available by default in Europe. This script provides a workaround by directly launching the associated UI.

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later

## Installation
1. Download the files from this repository.
2. Manually create a new folder on your system, e.g., `C:\Users\Public\Copilot`.
3. Copy the downloaded files into the newly created folder:
   - `Start-Copilot.ps1`
   - `Copilot.lnk`
   - `Microsoft-Copilot-Logo.ico`

## Usage
To start Windows Copilot, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the folder `C:\Users\Public\Copilot`.
2. Execute the script `Start-Copilot.ps1` by right-clicking it and selecting `Run with PowerShell`.
3. Optionally, you can pin the shortcut `Copilot.lnk` to your taskbar for quick access to Windows Copilot.

## Important Notes
- This script is merely a workaround and might be affected by future updates of Windows or changes to the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA).
- Please use this script responsibly and understand that usage is at your own risk.
